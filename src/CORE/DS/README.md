## Data 


Data is a collection of raw and unorganized facts that has no meaning. Genarally data means facts, observations, perception numbers, characters, symbols, image, etc. that are unprocessed.
- Example: **"1002, nxyzs, %323-"** are unproccessed facts that we can call data.
- A data has no meaning.
- A data is unproccessed.

## Information


When data is proccessed and It has a meaing to it, then we call it informission.</br>
Suppose, someones name is **"VIDED"** in raw unproccessed form. We cannot extract meanning from it.</br>
But, when we proccess the raw data it gives **"DEVID"** which is  a meanningful name. 

- Informations are set of data that are processed.
- Informations are meaningful , useful.
- Data is proccessed according to requirement and become information.

## Structure

- Some elementary items create a unit and that unit may be considered as a structure.
- A structure may be treated as a frame where we organize some elementary items in several ways.


## Data Structure
A data structure is a logical or mathmatical way of organizing data in computer so that it can be used efficiently.

**Example:** Array as a data structure.

## Algorithmic Complexity
Algortihm is set of instruction in a perticular program.
The analysis of algorithms is a major task in computer science.
Algorithmic complextiy is concern about how fast or slow a program runs.
To make an efficient program we have to concern about:-
- **Time Complexity:** <br>
Amount of time requires to complete number of operations is called time complexity. Time complexity depends on number of operation it performs.

  Time complexity noted as big-O notation eg:  **O(n)** . where, **n** is number of operations performed.

- **Space Complexity:**<br>
Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm. As with time complexity, we're mostly concerned with how the space needs grow, in big-Oh terms, as the size N of the input problem grows.
