# Plant Assets, Natural Resources, and Intangible Assets

## Plant Assets Expenditures

Plant assets are resources that have 
* physical substance, 
* are used in the operations of a business, 
* are not intended for sale to customers,
* are expected to be of use to the company for number of years.

Refered to as property, plant, and equipment; plant and equipment; and fixed assets.

Plant assets are critical to a company's success.

| Company | Plant assets(%) |
|---------|-----------------|
| Wendy's |  73%            |
| JetBlue Airways | 69%     |
| Walmart Stores  | 53%     |
| Apple           |  16%    |


### Determining the Cost of Plant assets

**Historical cost principle** requires that companies record plant assets at cost.

::: tip HINTS
**Cost consists of all expenditures necessary to acquire an asset and make it ready for its intended use.**

## Determing the Cost of Plant

### Assets
<br>

### 1. Land:
<br>
All neccessay cost incurred in making the land ready for intended use increase (debit) in the land account.

<br>

**Cost typically include:**
1. cash purchase price,
2. Closing costs such as title and attorney's fees,
3. real estate broker's commissions, and
4. accured property taxes and other liens on land assumed by purchaser.

::: tip Illustration
**Question:** Hayes Company acquires real estate at a cash cost of $100,000. The property contains an old warehouse that is razed at a net cost of $6,000 ($7,500 in costs less $1,500 proceeds from salvaged materials). Additional expenditures are the attorney’s fee, $1,000, and the real estate broker’s commission, $8,000. Determine the amount to be reported as the cost of the land.

**Determine the amount to be reported as the cost of the land.**

| Particulars             |    Land    |
|-------------------------|-----------:|
| Cash price of property  |  $ 100,000 |

### 2. Land Improvements:
<br>
**Structural addtions** with limited life made to land. **Cost includes all expenditures mecessary** to make improvements **ready for their intended use.**

* Examples: driveways, parking lots, fences, landscaping and undergroudn sprinklers
* Limited useful lives
* Expense (depreciate) cost of land improvements over their useful lives

### 3. Buildings:
<br>
**Includes all** necessary expenditures related directly to purchase or construction.

**Purchase Cost:**

* Purchase price, closing cost (attorney's fees, title insuracne, etc.) and real estate broker's commission.
* Remodeling and replacing or repairing the roof, floors, electrical wiring, and plumbing

**Construction Cost:**

* Contract Price
* Payments for architect's fees

<br>

**Includes all costs** incurred in acquiring the equipment and preparing it for use.

**Cost typically include:**

* Cash purchase price
* Sales taxes
* Freight charges
* Insurance during transit paid by purchaser

**Question:** Assume that Drummond Heating and Cooling Co. purchases a delivery truck for $15,000 cash, plus sales taxes of $900 and delivery costs of $500. The buyer also pays $200 for painting and lettering, $600 for an annual insurance policy, and $80 for a motor vehicle license. Explain how each of these costs would be accounted for.

**Determine the amount to be reported as the cost of the delivery truck.**

| Particulars             |    Delivery Truck   |
|-------------------------|--------------------:|
| Cash price              |  $ 15,000           |
| Sales Taxes             | 900                 |
| Delivery Cost           | 500                 |

| **Cost of Truck**        | $ 16,600           |


* **The payments for insurance and the license are operating costs incurred annually and therefore are expensed.**

## Depreciation Methods
<br>

**Proccess of allocating to expense** the cost of a plant asset over its useful (service) ife in a **rational and systematic manner.**
<br>
* Process of cost allocation, not asset valuation.
* Applies to land improvemnets, buildings, and equipment, not land.
* Depreciable because the revenue-producing ability of asset will decline over the asset's useful life.

### Factors in Computing Depreciation
<br>

* **Cost:** all expenditures necessary to acquire the asset and make it ready for intended use.
* **Useful life:** estimate of the expected life based on need for repair, service life, and vulnerability to no longer it used.
* **Salvage Value:** estimate of the asset's value at he end of useful life.

<br>

 **Alternative Terminology**

Another term sometimes used for salvage value is **residual value.**
<br>

::: warning HELPFUL HINTS
Depreciation expense is reported on the income statement. <br>
Accumulated depreciation is reported on the balance sheet as a deducation from plant assets.
:::

### Managment selects the Method
It believes best measures an asset's contribution to revenue over its useful life.

**Examples Include:**
1. Straight-line method
2. units-of-activiy method
3. Declining-Balance method

### QUESTION

Brab's Florist purchased a small delivery truck on Januray 1,2020.

|   Particulars    |    Units     |
|------|---------:|
| Cost | $ 13,000 |
| Expected salvage value | $ 1,000|
| Estimated useful life in years | 5 years|
| Estimated useful life miles | 100,000 miles |

**Required:** Compute depreciation using the following:
1. Straight-line method
2. units-of-activiy method
3. Declining-Balance method

## Straight-Line Method

* Expense is same amount for each year
* Depreciable cost = Cost less salvage value

**Cost - Salvage value = Depreciable Cost** <br>
$ 13,000 - $ 1,000   = $ 12,000
<br>

**Deprecaible cost / Useful life = Annual Depreciation Expense** <br>
$ 12,000 / 5 = $ 2,400

| Year | Depreciable Cost | Dep. Rate | Annual Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation        | Book Value  |

::: tip Example 
**Question:** On January 1, 2020, Iron Mountain Ski Corporation purchased a new snow-grooming machine for $50,000. The machine is estimated to have a 10-year life with a $2,000 salvage value. What journal entry would Iron Mountain Ski Corporation make at December 31, 2020, if it uses the straight-line method of depreciation?

**Solution:** <br>
**Cost - Salvage value = Depreciable Cost** <br>
 $ 50,000 - $ 2,000 = $ 48,000

**Deprecaible cost / Useful life = Annual Depreciation Expense** <br>
$ 48,000 / 10 = $ 4,800

**Journal entry**
| Particulars               | Debit  | Credit  |
|---------------------------|-------:|--------:|
| Depreciaiton Expense      | $ 4,800|         |
| Accumulated Depreciation  |        | 4,800   |
:::

## Units of Activity Method

* Companies estimate total units of activiy to calculate depreciation cost per unit 
* Expense varies based on units of activity
* Depreciable cost is cost less salvage value
* Often reffered to as units-of-production method

**Cost - Salvage value = Depreciable Cost** <br>
$ 13,000 - $ 1,000   = $ 12,000
<br>

**Deprecaible cost / Total Units of activity = Depreciable cost per unit** <br>
$ 12,000 / 100,000 miles = $ 0.12 per miles

**Deprecaible cost per unit * Units of activity during the year= Annual Depreciation Expense** <br>
$ 0.12 x 15,000 miles = $ 1,800

| Year | Units of activity | Dep. cost | Annual Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation        | Book Value  |
|-----:| ----------------:|------------------:|----------------------------:|-------------------------:|-----------:|
| 2020 | 15,000           | $ 0.12               | $ 2,400                     |       $ 2,400            | $ 10,600   |
| 2021 | $ 12,000         |  0.12             | $ 2,400                     |       $ 4,800            | $  8,200   |
| 2022 | $ 12,000         | 0.12             | $ 2,400                     |       $ 7,200            | $  5,800   |
| 2023 | $ 12,000         | 0.12               | $ 2,400                     |       $ 9,600            | $  3,400   |
| 2024 | $ 12,000         | 0.12              | $ 2,400                     |       $ 12,000           | $  1,000   |


## Declining Balance Method

* Accelerated method
* Decresing annual depreciation expense over asset's useful life
* Twice straght-line rate with double-declining balance
* Applied to declining book value
* Depreciation rate remains constant from year to year

**Book value at Begginning of year x Declining Balance Rate = Annula Depreciation Expense**
$ 13,000 x 40 % = $ 5,200
